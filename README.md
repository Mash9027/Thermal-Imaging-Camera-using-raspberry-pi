# Thermal-Imaging-Camera-using-raspberry-pi
In this repository we have a project prototype which uses a thermal camera MLX90640 to capture images and a Machine learning algorithm that checks whether a human is present in the picture and turns on the led accordingly.  
For this specific thermal imaging project, Machine learning using neural network algorithm with supervised learning approach was used. The reason for going with this approach was because this algorithm has three hidden layers that work together in analyzing and finding patterns in a given set of data. Each layer is responsible in detecting a pattern and when it does so, the next layer is activated. This project focuses on identifying presence of a human in the pictures taken by the camera every minute. 500 grey scale images were taken by the mlx90640 and were grouped into two separate files. One file was for positive results (human present in the picture) and a file to store negative results (no human in the picture). And then the model is trained upon these images to produce results. 3 layers of neuro networks were used in identifying patterns in the images taken to train the model to achieve high accuracy and efficiency. An Accuracy of 97% was reached during the testing phase. 

A detailed report is provided in the files attached.
